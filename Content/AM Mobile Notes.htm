        <h1>AM Mobile Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Imported summer 2015 from published Asset Manager Mobile Usage Manual. </li>
            <li>Reformatted slightly for consistency with CS manuals (page layout, cover, etc.). Login screen images annotated for replacement.</li>
            <li>Per Carol Ray, copyright and trademark should be consistent across all text (no conditions).</li>
            <li>Per current style guide, Professional Services page is backmatter for all manuals.</li>
            <li>A single Project has been created for AM/CS&#160;Mobile outputs; notes made here may be relevant only to AM&#160;or to the content shared by both targets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>08/26/15</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Features -- deleted “maximize the screen real-estate utilization and” as it adds nothing. Deleted “However, there are navigation and presentation differences in Product Mobile running on a tablet versus Product Mobile running on a smartphone.” Changed “web console” to “web interface” to match manuals. Added links to App Store and Google Play. Slight adjustment to Assets and Sensors text for logic and flow.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Haven't yet, but should revise text in Last Known Position. [Maybe replace that second sentence with “Each time you log in, Product Mobile opens to your last menu selection.”]</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Specifications -- e-mailed annotated doc to Gary Skiba with detailed query, no response to date.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Minimum requirements: needs update.  If not otherwise advised, I list  current plus one back, but I don't know your preference for mobile.  iOS 7.1.2 was released 6/30/14; current is 8.4.1; beta release 9.0 08/06/15.  Android latest release was 5.1.1 (Lollipop) 04/21/15; KitKat was 4.4.x<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Operating system: needs updates.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li>Installing Mobile -- Updated App Store directions per Aug 2015 iPad and Android tablet experience.  (Button descriptions and procedures)</li>
            <li>Getting Started with Mobile – would really prefer a different mobile user characterization for AM; currently says “data center managers”</li>
            <li>Configuring and Using – changed “login screen” to “Connect to Server screen” to match image</li>
            <li>Mobile Console Overview -- adjusted text to work with both products and current images</li>
            <li>Basic Navigation -- applied Example style to text already headed Example.  Not entirely sure about the numbering, though...may need to reset autonumbers per topic?  <b>Check after build!</b></li>
            <li>Main Menu -- not changed but noted: text-list duplicates image, adds nothing.</li>
            <li>Browse Assets by Type -- not changed but noted for followup: List of Asset Types differs from original text.  1) need out-of-box list for AM &amp; CS. 2) Need text explaining that asset types follow tree in main as set up by sysadm, assuming that's the case.</li>
            <li>Asset Details Screen -- slightly adjusted first para text for clarity.</li>
            <li>Basic Information Screen -- slightly adjusted first para text for clarity. Added sentence to Alerts button description in table:  “This button appears only when an asset has one or more active alerts.”</li>
            <li>Global Search -- reported to Gary/Bugzilla: search result accent dots color scheme not yet updated to marketing's preferred RFC blue/grey. <b style="font-style: italic;">When fixed, will un- and reinstall for new screenshots, I guess.</b></li>
            <li>Asset Filter Options -- not changed but noted: text-list duplicates image, adds nothing.</li>
            <li>Filtering for Assets or Sensors Only – image to be updated after bug-fix (dot colors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>08/24/15</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated App Store directions. (GET instead of FREE, etc.)</li>
            <li>Minor change to Security text to remove implication that HTTPS is by default.</li>
            <li>Global:&#160;replaced all instances of “Phone” with “smartphone,”&#160;and removed the cap from tablet. </li>
            <li>Mobile Console Overview -- description changed from “Assets”&#160;to “Asset Types”&#160;to match updated image.</li>
        </ul>

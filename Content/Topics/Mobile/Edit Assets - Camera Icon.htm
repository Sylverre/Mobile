        <h1>Edit Assets – Camera Icon</h1>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="strong">Edit</span> button for an Asset also enables you to add photos, using the <span class="strong">Camera</span> icon, to the Asset information, including the ability to use your Smartphone’s or tablet’s camera so that you can add photos to the Asset’s details.</p>
        <p>Any field that has the Camera icon <img src="../../Images/Mobile/camera icon.png" /> in the right side of it has the ability to use this feature.</p>
        <p>There is a Camera icon in the screenshot below from a tablet, and the Camera icon is highlighted to the right of the Asset Image field:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/assets by location camera.png" class="imgbordered" />
        </p>
        <p>This is very similar to the screenshot of the smartphone version below, and the Camera icon is identical:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/assets by location camera phone.png" class="imgbordered" />
        </p>
        <p>To take a photo, tap the <span class="strong">Camera</span> icon, and a <span class="strong">Get Image</span> dialog box will appear, similar to this screenshot below from a tablet:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/get image dialog.png" class="imgbordered" />
        </p>
        <p>You then will see three option buttons in the Get Image dialog box:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto;">
            <col style="width: 43px;">

                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>

                    <td>Gallery</td>
                    <td>Takes you to your device’s onboard photo Gallery, where you can
choose a photo from your gallery to use. Once a photo is chosen, it will be attached to the field you
are using, and you will automatically return to the Edit Asset screen.</td>

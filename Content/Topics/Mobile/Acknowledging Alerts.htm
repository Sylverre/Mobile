        <h1>Acknowledging Alerts</h1>
        <p>For alerts that require acknowledgment, you can also Acknowledge Alerts. The Acknowledge Alert button <img src="../../Images/Mobile/acknowledge alert button.png" />(highlighted below) appears when you view an alert that was configured to require acknowledgment.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Configuring alerts to require acknowledgment must be performed in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/alert acknowledge highlight.png" class="imgbordered" />
        </p>
        <p>After tapping the <span class="strong">Acknowledge Alert</span> button to acknowledge the alert, it will gray out, as seen below:</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the smartphone version, you have to tap the <span class="strong">Context Menu</span> button and then tap <span class="strong">ACK</span> in the drop-down menu in order to acknowledge an alert as there is no <span class="strong">Acknowledge</span> button in the smartphone version when you view an alert. An example of where the <span class="strong">ACK</span> is located in the smartphone version is shown in the screenshot below:</p>

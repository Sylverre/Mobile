        <h1>Browse Assets by Location</h1>
        <p>When tapping this option, you get a screen similar to the one below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/assets by location.png" class="imgbordered" />
        </p>
        <p>The location tree that you are presented to navigate in the left column above (which shows <span class="strong">Unknown Location</span> and <span class="strong">World</span> in the first tier in the location tree, in this example) depends on the location tree that was created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>The smartphone version of Locations will look similar to the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/Mobile/assets by location phone.png" class="imgbordered" />

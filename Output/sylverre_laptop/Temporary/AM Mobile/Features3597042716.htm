        <h3>Platform Coverage</h3>
        <p>Asset Manager Mobile runs on both iOS devices and Android devices. The application automatically determines if it is running on a smartphone or a tablet and adjusts accordingly to optimize the user experience. Asset Manager Mobile can be obtained from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en">Google Play Store</a> at no cost.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Asset Manager Mobile was designed with security in mind. All connections require authentication to the Asset Manager server and can be set up to require HTTPS. Furthermore, the App is VPN-friendly making it compatible with strong security restrictions. The Mobile App utilizes the core Asset Manager role-based authentication system.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Assets and Sensors</h3>
        <p>The core functionality of Asset Manager Mobile is to enable easy access to find, browse, view, add, edit and delete assets and sensors. The App provides an intuitive data browser that enables nagivation by location, asset type, or sensor type; and a simple yet powerful global search feature to quickly access any location, asset, or sensor defined in the system. </p>
        <p>The App also provides sophisticated filtering similar to the filtering capability in the standard web-based interface for Asset Manager. The filter control enables selection by type, location, and attribute, making it easy to find the exceptions that require action. Once a specific item is found, the App provides a detailed view of the item with hyperlinks to other pertinent information such as location data and alert information. If authenticated with the appropriate user information, Asset Manager Mobile allows adding, editing and deleting of assets and sensors. Asset Manager Mobile takes full advantage of device hardware features such as the built-in camera. The App can utilize the camera as a barcode scanner to quickly scan data to asset records, or to take a photo of an asset and associate that photo to the asset record.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Alerts and Alarms</h3>
        <p>Asset Manager Mobile enables fast access to alerts from Asset Manager. The Alert Viewer displays the most recent alerts at the top of a multi-line list. The default view lists high-level details about the alert such as date and time, asset name, alert name, and alert severity. Alerts can also be searched and viewed by category.</p>
        <p>The full details of an alert are easily accessible as well. The alert details view provides a hyperlink back to the asset that has triggered the alert. If the alert requires acknowledgment, the App displays the <span class="strong">Acknowledge</span> button as well.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Last Known Position</h3>
        <p>Interruptions occur when working in the field or on location and multitasking is a must. Asset Manager Mobile always returns you to the last location in the App before the interruption occurred. Furthermore, a convenient <span class="strong">Back</span> button (just like on a web browser) helps to save time and increase efficiency.</p>

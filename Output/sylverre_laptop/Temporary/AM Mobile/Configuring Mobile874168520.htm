        <p>After you start the application, you will see a Connect to Server screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/sylverre-laptop/Mobile/Output/sylverre_laptop/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_1B515787/Images/Mobile/initial server address request.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>The Server Address is the address where your Asset Manager resides so that the Asset ManagerMobile application can connect to it.</p>
        <p>To configure the server address:</p>
        <p>Tap the Server address field and input the server address. The Asset Manager Mobile application will automatically append “:6580” to the end of your address, by default, unless you specify a different port number. In most cases, your Asset Manager will be located on port 6580.</p>
        <p><span class="strong">Example #1:</span> Inputting the Server Address of “<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com” would automatically append the “:6580” so that it would appear as: “<span class="codefont"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:6580</span>” in the Server address field.</p>
        <p><span class="strong">Example #2:</span> Inputting the Server Address of “<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:4444” would not append anything since you specified a port number, so that it would appear as: “<span class="codefont"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:4444</span>” in the Server address field.</p>
        <p>A server connection error message will look similar to the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/sylverre-laptop/Mobile/Output/sylverre_laptop/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_1B515787/Images/Mobile/cannot connect to server.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>You could receive the above error for several reasons. The most common would be:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li value="1">Incorrect port number of your Asset Manager.</li>
            <li value="2">Incorrect address of your Asset Manager.</li>
            <li value="3">Your Asset Manager is not version 2.9 or higher.</li>
            <li value="4">Your smartphone or tablet does not have Internet connectivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, please note that on subsequent connections after a successful connection using Asset Manager Mobile, that the Asset Manager Mobile application will store and list those successful connections. In the case of multiple servers where you have made a successful connection, they will be listed (as in the screenshot below) so that you may choose/tap on the server that you want to connect to. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/sylverre-laptop/Mobile/Output/sylverre_laptop/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_1B515787/Images/AM Mobile/AM Multiple servers.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>After you successfully connect to your Asset Manager server, you will be presented with the following login screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/sylverre-laptop/Mobile/Output/sylverre_laptop/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_1B515787/Images/AM Mobile/AM login or change.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>Here you will log in with the normal login credentials to <span style="mc-tag-and-class: span;">Asset Manager</span>. Note that the address of the server you are accessing now appears above the fields for <span class="strong">User name</span> and <span class="strong">Password</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="strong">Change Server</span> button gives you the ability to go back to the <span class="strong">Server Address</span> screen (the previous screen) to change which Asset Manager server you are accessing.</p>
        <p>If you have a problem logging in using certain credentials, you must log in to<span class="strong"> <![CDATA[ ]]></span><span style="mc-tag-and-class: span;">Asset Manager</span> itself to reset or modify any particular logins.</p>
        <p>When you type in the credentials, you can clear them by clicking on the <img src="file:///C:/Users/sylverre-laptop/Mobile/Output/sylverre_laptop/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_1B515787/Images/Mobile/clear x.bmp" /> that appears in the right part of the text field, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>

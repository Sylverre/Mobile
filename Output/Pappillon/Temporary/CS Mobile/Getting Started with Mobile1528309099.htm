        <p>The CenterScape Mobile software strengthens the level at which data center managers can monitor and control their facilities. With its live, real-time data and interactive features, the platform allows greater visibility and interaction from wireless devices at any time of the day or night.</p>
        <p>Running on both iOS and Android devices, the core functionality of CenterScape Mobile is to enable easy access to find, browse, view, add, edit and delete assets and sensors. The app provides a simple yet powerful global search feature to quickly access any location, asset or sensor defined in the system. Alert conditions (such as security violations or elevated temperature or humidity readings) are also sent directly to CenterScape Mobile, enabling immediate, proactive responses to critical issues.</p>

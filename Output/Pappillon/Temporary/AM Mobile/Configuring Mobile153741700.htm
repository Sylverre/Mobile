        <h2 MadCap:xrefTargetName="Configuring and Using Asset Manager Mobile"><a MadCap:generatedBookmark="TOC" name="Configuring and Using Asset Manager Mobile"></a>Configuring and Using Asset Manager Mobile</h2>
        <p>After you start the application, you will see a login screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pappillon/Mobile/Output/Pappillon/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_32E51674/Images/Mobile/initial server address request.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>The Server Address is the address where your Asset Manager resides so that the Asset Manager Mobile application can connect to it.</p>
        <p>To configure the server address:</p>
        <p>Tap the Server address field and input the server address. The Asset Manager Mobile application will automatically append “:6580” to the end of your address, by default, unless you specify a different port number. In most cases, your Asset Manager will be located on port 6580.</p>
        <p><span class="strong">Example #1:</span> Inputting the Server Address of “<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com” would automatically append the “:6580” so that it would appear as: “<span class="codefont"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:6580</span>” in the Server address field.</p>
        <p><span class="strong">Example #2:</span> Inputting the Server Address of “<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:4444” would not append anything since you specified a port number, so that it would appear as: “<span class="codefont"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only">am</MadCap:conditionalText>.yourcompany.com:4444</span>” in the Server address field.</p>
        <p>A server connection error message will look similar to the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pappillon/Mobile/Output/Pappillon/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_32E51674/Images/Mobile/cannot connect to server.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>You could receive the above error for several reasons. The most common would be:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li value="1">Incorrect port number of your Asset Manager.</li>
            <li value="2">Incorrect address of your Asset Manager.</li>
            <li value="3">Your Asset Manager is not version 2.9 or higher.</li>
            <li value="4">Your smartphone or tablet does not have Internet connectivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, please note that on subsequent connections after a successful connection using Asset Manager Mobile, that the Asset Manager Mobile application will store and list those successful connections. In the case of multiple servers where you have made a successful connection, they will be listed (as in the screenshot below) so that you may choose/tap on the server that you want to connect to. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pappillon/Mobile/Output/Pappillon/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_32E51674/Images/AM Mobile/AM Multiple servers.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>After you successfully connect to your Asset Manager server, you will be presented with the following login screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pappillon/Mobile/Output/Pappillon/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_32E51674/Images/AM Mobile/AM login or change.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />
        </p>
        <p>Here you will log in with the normal login credentials to <span style="mc-tag-and-class: span;">Asset Manager</span>. Note that the address of the server you are accessing now appears above the fields for <span class="strong">User name</span> and <span class="strong">Password</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="strong">Change Server</span> button gives you the ability to go back to the <span class="strong">Server Address</span> screen (the previous screen) to change which Asset Manager server you are accessing.</p>
        <p>If you have a problem logging in using certain credentials, you must log in to<span class="strong">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span><span style="mc-tag-and-class: span;">Asset Manager</span><span class="strong">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span>itself to reset or modify any particular logins.</p>
        <p>When you type in the credentials, you can clear them by clicking on the “X” that appears in the right part of the text field, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Pappillon/Mobile/Output/Pappillon/Temporary/AM Mobile/AM Mobile_32E51674/Images/AM Mobile/AM clear credentials.png" class="imgbordered" MadCap:conditions="Default.AM only" />

        <h1>Asset Location and Detected Location</h1>
        <p>Not really ready to release this to the world, but maybe some screenshots will help?</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Racks have no tags here -- and of course the IR locator beacon doesn’t show -- so asset tag, assigned to, and location verified are blank for the racks themselves. The storage assets are tagged, and would have little green LEDs in a Rack View; they are assigned to some location, and their status is location verified. &#160;Which means what, please? That their tags are being read?</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Detected Location appears to be quite different from Location! Only a few, up at the top, have a Location Verified, and they’re all Available, as opposed to Installed or Operational. Help?</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Manage Assets, filtered for location brings up fifteen pages worth of data, far fewer than the others do. But all the Servers, Status Available, have Location Verified.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This is fun! Assigned to -- is that a summary location?&#160;&#160;Possibly, since the next is Assigned Location, that’s probably what you-the-user input when creating the asset, and then Detected Location, which is where the reader reports the tag associated with the asset.</p>
        <p>...I think.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The highlighted item is one I reassigned, playing around in CS. It had been in Datahall 1200, so the detected location is correct. Let’s see how to get it back there...</p>
        <p>Well, no, that’s a Summary location. Click on Edit, click the Assigned To...ellipsis, get a second pop-up over the first pop-up:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Select the desired location (is Data Hall really a summary location?&#160;&#160;I&#160;know the Type says Summary Location, but there’s no summary icon in the location hierarchy--of course, those don’t appear on the User Console. Sigh). Click OK. Item *poofs* away from the Unresolved Locations asset list.</p>
        <p>Item does, however, now appear in the Unresolved Locations list for its appropriate data hall.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Location Verified?&#160;&#160;No. Is that time-dependent, waiting for the next time a reader reports?&#160;&#160;Check back before leaving for the evening!</p>

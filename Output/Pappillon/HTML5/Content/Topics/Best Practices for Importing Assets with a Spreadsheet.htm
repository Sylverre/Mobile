        <h1>Best Practices for Importing Assets with a Spreadsheet</h1>
        <p>System administrators may choose to use a spreadsheet to import and configure certain settings for a particular group of assets that will be used in the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system. This method is particularly useful if you need to import several assets of the same asset type. The process involves customization of a CSV file where tag IDs and asset attributes are configured to an administrator's particular requirements.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of best practices for importing assets with the use of a CSV spreadsheet:</p>
        <p class="note">Ensure that there is at least one asset configured in your system that is the same asset type that you will be configuring using the spreadsheet importing method.</p>
        <p>Create a custom view for the asset types that you will be importing with the spreadsheet by navigating to the <span class="Strong">User Console &gt; Customization &gt; Views</span> and click on the <span class="Strong">New</span> button. Enter a Name and Description (optional) for the View. Select the asset type(s) that you will be importing into your system. Select the required attributes for the Import CSV file creation for this example [Name, Asset Tag, Asset Type, Lock Location, and any additional asset attributes you would like to configure with the CSV spreadsheet for the set of assets you will be importing (optional)]. Click the <span class="Strong">Save Changes</span> button to save the asset view.</p>
        <p>Figure 209: Asset Manager Custom View Creation</p>
        <p>2. Navigate to <span class="Strong">Assets &gt; Manage Assets By Type</span> and select the custom view that you just created from the views drop-down list in the top, right-hand corner of the screen. The view will change to your custom view and you will see the asset(s) that you configured in the view. Click the <span class="Strong">Export</span> button and select <span class="Strong">"Export asset attributes in view"</span>. Click the <span class="Strong">Export CSV</span> button.</p>
        <p>Figure 210: Export CSV File of Custom View</p>
        <p>Open the CSV file in Microsoft Excel or other software to edit the CSV file. Delete the columns titled "retired" and "deletable". Enter the information for the assets for each of the required fields (class, type, guid, $aLocation, $aName, $aAssetTag, $aLockLocation for this example) that you are going to add to the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system. Also input a value for your specified custom attributes (optional). Please note the following tips for the populating of attribute columns:</p>
        <p>TIP:&#160;The fields that are required to have a value specified in the import CSV file will depend upon whether that field is required for the asset types of the assets you will be configuring using the CSV file. You can determine which fields are required for a particular Asset Type by accessing the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> <span class="Strong">Administrator Console &gt; Data Schema &gt; Asset Types</span>, selecting the desired Asset Type from the asset tree and clicking the View Sample Input Form button. The sample input form will appear for that particular Asset Type. Within that sample input form there should be one or more fields with a red asterisk (*) in front of it. This indicates that it is a required field for the Asset Type and therefore, that field must be included in the CSV file and must have a value for the import of the CSV file to be successful in creating the assets in the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system.</p>
        <p>All entries for the "class" column will be "entity" for every asset that will be configured in the CSV file.</p>
        <p>The entry values for the "guid" column can be found by locating the Asset Type or Attribute (title of the column) in the <span class="Strong">Administrator Console &gt; Data Schema &gt; Asset Attributes</span> or <span class="Strong">Administrator Console &gt; Data Schema &gt; Custom Attribute Types</span> sub-tasks in the ID field. Type the guid value from the ID field into the required field in the CSV file for the Asset Type.</p>
        <p>Each entry for $aName field must be a completely unique value. You cannot import two assets with the same Name.</p>
        <p>Figure 211: Example CSV Import File Configured for Multiple Asset Creation</p>
        <p>In this example we will be adding a mixture of Inventory Assets and Sensor Assets. These Asset Types are derived from the data schema. You will notice in the figure above that the type column has both SERVER and HUMMIDITY_TEMPERATURE Asset Types.</p>
        <p>The guid field has a value for the asset that was exported from <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. This was be automatically generated by the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. If the cell values for this column are left blank, the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> will generate a unique guid for the asset upon import.</p>
        <p>The $aLocations field value has been automatically generated for the exported asset by <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. If the Locations field values are left blank in the file, <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> will automatically assign a Location to the asset based on the Locations/Rules that have been configured in <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. If no rules apply to the asset, then the asset will be assigned to "Unknown Location". This works well for Inventory Asset Types because these assets will likely be mobile assets in an <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system that dynamic location data will be desired for tracking location. However, for Sensor Asset Types, these are generally stationary locations because they have been installed in a specific place (such as a room, rack or closet) to monitor the environmental conditions of that area. So a static location will need to be configured. In <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> this is done through a specification of the sensor's static location and by setting the $aLockLocation field value to true. Meaning that the sensor is in a set stationary location and will not move. So for this example, you will see in the above figure that a value has been assigned for the Location fields for the two sensor assets and that the Lock Location fields have been set to the value of TRUE.</p>
        <p>Each entry for $aName field must be a completely unique value. Notice in the figure above that for each asset the Name field value is unique. The import to the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system will fail and prompt an error message if two or more assets are present in the CSV file with the same Name.</p>
        <p>For the $aAssetTag field values, you need to assign an Asset Tag ID to each of the assets that you will be creating. The Asset Tag ID consists of the Group Code and Tag ID that are present on the label of each tag that you will be associating to an asset.</p>
        <p>Figure 212: Group ID, Tag ID, and Treatment Code Location</p>
        <p>Once you have completed the Import CSV file configuration, save the file. Navigate to <span class="Strong">User Console &gt; Assets &gt; Import Assets</span> and browse and select the file for import. Click the <span class="Strong">Upload</span> button.</p>
        <p>Figure 213: Import CSV File to Create Assets</p>
        <p>The configured assets will now appear in your <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> system.</p>

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <h2>Platform Coverage</h2>
        <p><span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile runs on both iOS devices and Android devices. The application automatically determines if it is running on a smartphone or a tablet and adjusts accordingly to maximize the screen real-estate utilization and optimize the user experience. However, there are navigation and presentation differences in <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile running on a tablet versus <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile running on a smartphone. <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile can be obtained from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en">Google Play Store</a> at no cost.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p><span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile was designed with security in mind. All connections utilize HTTPS and require authentication to the <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> server. Furthermore, the App is VPN friendly making it compatible with strong security restrictions. The Mobile App utilizes the core <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> role-based authentication system.</p>
        <h2>Assets and Sensors</h2>
        <p>The core functionality of <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile is to enable easy access to find, browse, view, add, edit and delete assets and sensors. The App provides a simple yet powerful global search feature to quickly access any location, asset or sensor defined in the system. For the purposes of browsing information in <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>, the App includes an intuitive data browser that enables navigation by location, asset type, or sensor type.</p>
        <p>The App also provides sophisticated filtering similar to the filtering capability in the standard web-based console for <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. The filter control enables selection by type, location, and attribute, making it easy to find the exceptions that require action. Once a specific item is found, the App provides a detailed view of the item with hyperlinks to other pertinent information such as location data and alert information. If authenticated with the appropriate user information, <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile allows adding, editing and deleting of assets and sensors. <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile takes full advantage of device hardware features such as the built in camera. The App can utilize the camera as a barcode scanner to quickly scan in data to entry fields. Furthermore, the App has the ability to take a photo of an asset and associate that photo to the asset record.</p>
        <h2>Alerts and Alarms</h2>
        <p><span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile enables fast access to alerts from <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span>. The Alert Viewer displays the most recent alerts at the top of a multi-line list. The default view lists high-level details about the alert such as date and time, asset name, alert name, and alert severity. Alerts can also be searched and viewed by category.</p>
        <p>The full details of an alert are easily accessible as well. The alert details view provides a hyperlink back to the asset that has triggered the alert. If the alert requires acknowledgment, the App displays the <span class="strong">Acknowledge</span> button as well.</p>
        <h2>Last Known Position</h2>
        <p>Interruptions occur when working in the field or on location and multitasking is a must. <span class="GeneralProductName">CenterScape</span> Mobile always returns you to the last location in the App before the interruption occurred. Furthermore, a convenient <span class="strong">Back</span> button (just like on a web browser) helps to save time and increase efficiency.</p>

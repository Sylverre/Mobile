        <h1>Locations, Rules, Maps</h1>
        <p>The Locations/Rules/Maps task menu allows administrators to create a location hierarchy that reflects the organization’s physical locations, to associate rules to correctly determine which tag is in which location, and also to associate the asset locations to a custom map. Correctly configuring Locations/Rules/Maps requires careful planning. With this task, locations or “zones” are assigned to the reader so that with the assistance of the Zone Manager(s), tag location data can be interpreted. Assigning various rules to locations can help to fine tune the interpretation of tag location through the specification of reader channel SSI thresholds. Finally, with these finely tuned locations and rules, the asset can then be visibly associated with a location on a map. There are three sub-tasks available in this task. There are two main task panes, the hierarchy pane (on the left) and the task pane (on the right).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are three sub-tasks that an administrator can access in the task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Locations &amp; Rules</li>
            <li value="2">Map Configuration</li>
            <li value="3">Map Views</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">The Restrictable checkbox can be selected for the built-in root location (name “Location” in the location tree) to restrict access to other locations that are created as an additional security feature. Please refer to the Security section of this document for more information regarding user data segmentation and security.</p>
